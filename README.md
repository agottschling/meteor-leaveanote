Leave A Note!
=============

After a few days of planning out a project that would utilize [MeteorJS](https://meteor.com), I settled on this: a simple web app to put up public sticky notes! It certainly turned out to be a fun weekend of experimentation with HTML, CSS and JavaScript!

To-do (maybe?)
--------------
* deploy to somewhere more permanent (suggestions welcome on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Sammsid))
* display date/time according to user locale
* add sticky color choice - keep random (currently only random)
* character limit on sticky + "read more" for a larger sticky (ideas???)
* long-term: account support, filtering, private stickies, etc.
